# Tensor-TrianglePatches
Tensor Bezier Patch and Triangle Bezier Patch are fundamental techniques
in computer graphics for creating complex surfaces. Tensor Bezier Patches utilize
control points in both directions, offering flexibility in shaping surfaces in both
the u and v directions. In contrast, Triangle Bezier Patches construct surfaces through 
triangular subdivisions. These techniques are crucial for achieving smooth and realistic surfaces in various applications.

The application template originates from a school project and includes control elements.
My part of the code is responsible for the logic of continuous patch blending and the related behavior of vertices.
